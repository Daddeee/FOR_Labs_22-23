        "\n",
        "In this lab we'll see two well-known optimization problems, which will show how modeling techniques and valid inequalities can help tighten the LP relaxation. Specifically:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. For a location problem, which is a discrete optimization problem, we take its LP relaxation. We start from a \"weak\" formulation and see how adding inequalities from a \"stronger\" formulation can help increasing the lower bound and how it changes the solution to the LP problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. (See part II in a separate notebook) For the _knapsack_ problem, we begin from its LP relaxation and introduce _cover_ inequalities, and see what impact they have on the dual bound and on the solution itself.\n",

        "A region wants to build $p$ airports to serve a set $N = \\{0,1,\\ldots{},n-1\\}$ of $n$ cities. There are $m>p$ candidate sites for the airports, each with an estimate cost $c_j$ to build an airport at location $j$ for $j\\in M=\\{0,1,...,m-1\\}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each airport can serve a subset of cities, and it is assumed that every city $i$ is served by __one__ airport $j$. The 20-year cost of maintaining the road between city $i$ and airport $j$, mostly proportional to the distance between $i$ and $j$, is denoted as $d_{ij}$. It is calculated as $400k$ euro per km.\n",

        "* for each city $i$: city $i$ is served by one airport: $\\sum_{j\\in M} x_{ij} = 1 \\forall i\\in N$;\n",
        "* the last class of constraints is tricky: if one or more cities $i\\in N$ are served by airport $j$, then $y_j$ must be 1. This constraint is not explicit in the definition of the problem, but it is a result of our modeling choice with variables. We'll formulate it this way:\n",

        "\n",

Viceversa, if any $x_{ij}$ is 1, then the sum on the left-hand side is positive and this forces $y_j$ to be 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that the multiplier for $y_j$ is $n$ for a reason: if it was $k<n$, then we would forbid more than $k$ cities from being assigned to airport $j$, which is likely but not certain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's define the parameters. For better representation, we'll assign (x,y) coordinates to cities and airports, determine the city/airport distance matrix as the Euclidean distances between each, and then assign random building cost to all airports"
