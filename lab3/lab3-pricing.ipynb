The problem is defined as in part I, with the exception that $A$ and $c$ have more elements. Their value is specified directly in the code snippet after this cell. The first four elements of $c$ and the first four columns of $A$ are the same as in the previous exercise. The availability is the same as in the previous part:\n",
