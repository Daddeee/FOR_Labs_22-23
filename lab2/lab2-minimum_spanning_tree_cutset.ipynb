    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "A formulation of the MST problem uses *cut sets*: given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $V$ the set of nodes and $E$ the set of edges, we create binary variables $x_{ij}$ for each $(i,j)\\in E$ such that $x_{ij}$ is 1 if $(i,j)$ is in the solution, 0 otherwise. Then the formulation includes $cut set$ inequalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *cut* $\\delta(S)$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a subset of edges generated by a subset of nodes $S\\subset V$: an edge $(i,j)\\in E$ is in $\\delta(S)$ if exactly one among $i$ and $j$ is in $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulation enforces the following condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "__For any cut $\\delta(S)$ containing the set of edges $(i,j)$ with $i$ in $S\\subset V$ and $j$ in $V\\setminus S$, there must be at least one edge of $\\delta(S)$ in the solution.__\n",
